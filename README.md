## User Experience (UX) & Design

For this project, the user interface is crafted to be intuitive and engaging, despite the limitations of a command-line format. The aim is to deliver a visually appealing experience through effective text formatting. Important information is centered on the screen for prominence, while text effects are used sparingly to enhance readability without distracting the user.

To achieve a refined look, spaces and line breaks are strategically positioned to highlight key messages and actions. This method fosters a clean and organized layout, directing the user's focus to essential elements of the game, including instructions, prompts, and results.
